* Helpful

Make the doc-string look beautiful and add additional context.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :config
    ;; Note that the built-in `describe-function' includes both functions
    ;; and macros. `helpful-function' is functions only, so we provide
    ;; `helpful-callable' as a drop-in replacement.
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-h f") #'helpful-callable)

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-h v") #'helpful-variable)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-h k") #'helpful-key)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-h x") #'helpful-command)

    ;; Lookup the current symbol at point. C-c C-d is a common keybinding
    ;; for this in lisp modes.
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-d") #'helpful-at-point)

    ;; Look up *F*unctions (excludes macros).
    ;;
    ;; By default, C-h F is bound to `Info-goto-emacs-command-node'. Helpful
    ;; already links to the manual, if a function is referenced there.

* Undo-tree

Get undo history in a tree, very helpful because normally undo and redo work in linear way. But with this you can undo in non-linear way. This is show you a tree and you can move through tree to get to your desired position in undo history.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package undo-tree
    :diminish global-undo-tree-mode
    :init
    (setq undo-tree-auto-save-history t)
    (setq undo-tree-history-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.cache/emacs-backup-files")))
    :config
    (global-undo-tree-mode 1))
